In today's modern world of technology user require the desired results very quick and efficient. Searching for a particular should be easy so that user can access qucikly and learn the things in lesser time. There are various search engines like google, yahoo,bing which provide to the user the most relevant search results. But these results are mostly ranked on the basis of page rank algorithm which sometimes do not have the relevant content according to the search query. While various marketing strategies are used by websites inorder to rank higher on the results shown by the search engine. There various techniques like black hat,white hat techniques. This techniques takes the user away from the desired search and keeps the user wandering around the irrelevant sites.
Inoder to avoid this,our project tries to create a percipient and cognitive search engine that provides user most relevant content to the desired search query. It eases the process of searching by avoiding the user to go through all the documents in the search results. The search engine directly provides the most relevant paragraphs or text  by scanning all the documents in the indexed search results. The key feature of this search engine is that all the meta tags are removed and only the content or the text is scanned on a particular site or a page. Sometimes by increasing the tags or repeating the text inorder to rank the site high in the search results these techniques are used. Mainly the search engine tries to focus on relevant content so that user can easily access it.

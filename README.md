The project is an attempt to build a smarter search engine. Existing search engines use extensive crawlers and index these results based on the content, metadata and the sites that link to it. When a user enters a search query in an existing search engine, he is presented with a number of relevant links which are ranked by some proprietary algorithms (eg: PageRank) and a few sentences from that page containing the keyword.
Our project tries to ease the process of searching for a particular topic on the internet. The approach to search that has been noticed in students researching a particular topic is to open up numerous tabs and then go through it manually. Our project will serve as a dashboard for all the results. It will cache the heat web pages and then perform content search. It will summarize the content with emphasis on the keywords in the search query. It will also mine and summarize academic papers that are freely available. All these summaries will have links to their full pages.
If it is a current hot-topic, it will have presence on social media such as Twitter too. We will include an option to search Twitter feeds, which will display to the user prominent tweets (based on no. of RTs/favorites/likes) with a brief sentiment analysis on that feed.
